# track-h-https — Handoff Prompt

Copy-paste everything below this line into the next session to pick up the torch.

---

You are continuing a multi-session build of **pure-Rail TLS 1.3** on branch `track-h-https`. Your mission is to finish what remains so that `https_get` works against `api.anthropic.com:443` with zero C dependencies beyond `as`/`ld`.

## Where to work

- **Worktree:** `/Users/ledaticempire/projects/rail-https`
- **Branch:** `track-h-https` (cut from `next-v2.10`)
- **HEAD at handoff:** `260aebc` (`rail: stdlib/tls13_client — Layer 5b.6`)
- **Do not touch:** `/Users/ledaticempire/projects/rail/` (main tree), `master`, `rail-checkpoint`, `rail-bpe-perf`, etc. This branch is isolated by design.

Start every session with:
```bash
cd /Users/ledaticempire/projects/rail-https
git log --oneline -8
./rail_native test   # should print 137/137 tests passed (if it hangs at t131, see §Harness below)
```

## What's already shipped (don't redo)

Read `docs/TLS_DESIGN.md` for the Option A/B/C debate. We picked A (pure Rail). Each commit below is RFC-vector-verified — don't second-guess them, audit only if a downstream layer produces wrong output.

| 5b.3: record wrap/unwrap | `ab1ab2e` | `stdlib/tls13_record.rail` — `tls13_record_encrypt`/`_decrypt` |
| 5b.4: post-SH msg parsers | `a4fc06a` | `tls13_hs_read_msg`, `parse_encrypted_extensions`, `parse_certificate`, `parse_certificate_verify`, `parse_finished` |

| 5b.6: client FSM | `260aebc` | `stdlib/tls13_client.rail` — `tls13_client_handshake_offline` |

## What's left (your job)

### Layer 5b.7 — RFC 8448 §3 end-to-end trace test (SMALL, DO FIRST)

The current 5b.6 commit has only a smoke test. Validate the whole FSM composition against RFC 8448 §3 "Simple 1-RTT Handshake" byte dumps.

- Source: RFC 8448 §3. Fetch the full trace:
  - client x25519 private: `49af42ba7f7994852d713ef2784bcbcaa7911de26adc5642cb634540e7ea5005`
  - server x25519 public (in ServerHello key_share): `c9828876112095fe66762bdbf7c672e156d6cc253b833df1dd69b1b04e751f0f`
  - Shared secret: `8bd4054fb55b9d63fdfbacf9f04b9f0d35e6d63f537563efd46272900f89492d`
  - handshake_secret: `1dc826e93606aa6fdc0aadc12f741b01046aa6b99f691ed221a9f0ca043fbeac`

  - c_hs_traffic: `b3eddb126e067f35a780b3abf45e2d8f3b1a950738f52e9600746a0e27a55a21`
  - server Finished verify_data: `9b9b141d906337fbd2cbdce71df4deda4ab42c309572cb7fffee5454b78f0718`
- Build a standalone Rail program (do NOT add to the test harness — see §Harness). It should feed the full Handshake-framed CH, SH, and decrypted server flight bytes into `tls13_client_handshake_offline` and verify c_ap, s_ap, and the output client_Finished match RFC 8448 §3.
- **RFC 8448 §3 uses TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, NOT ChaCha20-Poly1305.** Our AEAD is ChaCha20 only. This means we can't decrypt §3's actual ciphertexts — but the FSM takes *plaintext* flight as input, so we can feed the already-decrypted handshake bytes straight in. The hash + key schedule portions of RFC 8448 §3 validate regardless of cipher suite.
- If numbers don't match, the bug is almost certainly in transcript boundary offsets (off-by-one between CV end and SF start) or in how we concatenate the flight into the transcript. Instrument by printing transcript hashes after each message and comparing to hand-computed SHA-256s.

### Layer 6 — X.509 + signature verify (THE BIG LIFT)

Without this, connections are unauthenticated (anyone who answers on port 443 owns your TLS session). Two sub-pieces:

1. **ASN.1 DER parser.** New `stdlib/asn1.rail`. Minimum: parse a TBSCertificate far enough to extract:
   - Subject Public Key (algorithm OID + key bytes)
   - Signature algorithm OID on the outer Certificate
   - Signature bytes on the outer Certificate
   Don't try to fully parse X.509 — just enough to get the server's pubkey for signature verify. Defer name matching, SAN, validity period, chain walking to "Layer 6b" or later.
2. **Signature verification.** TLS 1.3 servers in the wild almost all use either:
   - **ECDSA-P256** (sig_alg 0x0403) — needs a Weierstrass curve implementation. Similar complexity to X25519 (~300-500 lines). This is the preferred path.
   - **RSA-PSS** (sig_alg 0x0804) — needs 2048-bit modexp (bignum). Bigger lift.
   Pick one (recommend ECDSA-P256) and accept the other as a "cipher suite not supported" fail. Most CDN fronts (Cloudflare, Fastly, what Anthropic sits behind) serve both; we can negotiate to what we support via the `signature_algorithms` extension we already send.
3. **Wire into FSM.** Add a `tls13_verify_cert_signature cert_bytes sig_alg sig_bytes transcript_hash` step to `tls13_client_handshake_offline`. On failure, return valid=0.

This is the credibility gate. A TLS stack that skips cert verify is a toy. Don't ship Layer 7 until Layer 6 is real.

### Layer 7 — http_client wire-up

Open `stdlib/http_client.rail`. Add `https_get url` and `https_post_json url json_body`. Under the hood:

1. Parse url → (host, port, path).
2. Open TCP via `stdlib/socket.rail` (already exists, already used for HTTP).
3. Call `tls13_client_hello host` to get the CH wire bytes.
4. Send CH, recv until we have a full TLSPlaintext(ServerHello) record. Parse.
5. Loop: recv encrypted records, `tls13_record_decrypt` them with server_handshake_key/iv + running seq counter, accumulate decrypted bytes. Stop when you've accumulated EE + Cert + CV + SF.
6. Call `tls13_client_handshake_offline` with the collected pieces.
7. Derive application write_key/write_iv from c_ap_traffic via `tls13_derive_key`/`_iv`.
8. Encrypt the HTTP request (`GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: ...\r\n\r\n`) via `tls13_record_encrypt` with content_type=23 (application_data), seq=0.
9. Recv encrypted response records, decrypt, concatenate HTTP response body. Handle chunked transfer by reusing the existing `http_client.rail` chunked decoder.
10. Close.

Test: `https_get "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages"` should return a 4xx/5xx (not a TLS error). That's the merge criterion.

### Merge criteria (from `docs/TLS_DESIGN.md`)

Don't merge to `next-v2.10` until ALL pass:
- 116/116 core tests still pass (currently 137 — we grew the baseline).
- 2-pass self-compile byte-identical (fixed point).
- `https_get` against `api.anthropic.com` returns a real HTTP status line.
- Existing HTTP (non-S) API 100% byte-compatible.
- socat removed from `~/.fleet/tls_proxies.sh`'s critical path (or kept as a fallback).

## Hard-earned lessons (READ THIS)

### §Harness — The test harness reliably hangs on long-source tests

t131 (`tls13_handshake_msg_parsers`, ~1418-char source embedded in compile.rail as a string literal, includes a 14-element `cat` in `print`) **reliably hangs at 100% CPU + 1.2GB RSS** in `compile_program` when invoked as the 131st `run_test` in the same process. Same source runs in 0.9s standalone. Symptom: stuck after `--- tls13_handshake_msg_parsers ---` with no further output.

The build that produced `a4fc06a` (which includes t131) happened to complete once — flaky, not deterministic. Suspect: conservative GC false-keep amplifying arena fragmentation at long-string allocation boundaries.

**DO NOT add new tests with long (>1000 char) source strings to the in-tree test harness.** Validate standalone via `/tmp/test_*.rail` files. Document the RFC vector validation in the commit message. This is fine — every primitive is RFC-verified at its own layer.

Real fix if you want to pay it off: thread `arena_mark`/`arena_reset` between `run_test` calls in `tools/compile.rail:3496`. Or move test sources out of compile.rail into external files loaded at test-init. Don't do this unless the hang becomes blocking.

If the harness hangs during your session, check `ps` for `./rail_native test` at 100% CPU — if it's been stuck >3 min with no new output in `/tmp/rail_out` (check `stat -f "%m" /tmp/rail_out`), it's the t131 hang. `pkill -9 rail_native` and move on.

### §Imports don't dedupe

Rail imports are textual. Importing `stdlib/bytes.rail` twice via different paths causes duplicate-symbol linker errors (`.Lfn_mask32_start already defined`). Check the import graph before adding imports:

- `tls13_client.rail` imports `x25519.rail` (self-contained) + `tls13_hs.rail` (which chains to bytes).
- If you need record layer in the client FSM (Layer 7 will), you can't add `import "stdlib/tls13_record.rail"` — it would pull bytes.rail in through a second path. Either inline the record calls at the call site, or factor out a common "crypto base" import that tls13_hs and tls13_record both depend on.

### §Rail parser quirks earned this branch

1. **No hex literals.** `0xFF` parses silently as `0`. Use `hex_to_bytes` decoder for every crypto constant.
2. **Layer 0 `rotl` is 64-bit, not 32-bit.** For 32-bit rotations (SHA-256, ChaCha20) use the shift-OR pattern: `(x << n) | (x >> (32-n))` masked to 32 bits. See `bytes.rail:rotl32`.
3. **`main = <expr>` returns via exit code mod 256.** Test programs printing results must use `let _ = print (show x); 0`.
4. **Nested 2-arg builtin calls can typecheck-warn "3 args".** `bit_and (bit_or a b) c` — use let-bindings.
5. **Leading `+` on a continuation line is a parse error.** `x +\n  y` fails. Put the whole expression on one line, or parenthesize differently.
6. **63-bit tagged int ceiling matters for crypto.** Rotations that set bit 63 lose the top bit on re-tag. Fine for 32-bit crypto because ops mask with `& 0xFFFFFFFF` after each op.

### §Validation discipline

Every new primitive must have an RFC vector test. Hand-derived expected values introduced typos twice on this branch (SHA-256 K[31..63]). RFC canonical source is load-bearing. If you can't find an RFC vector for what you're implementing, you're implementing the wrong thing — go look harder.

## Useful invariants to check

After any change:

```bash
./rail_native self                              # recompile compiler
cp /tmp/rail_self rail_native                   # install
./rail_native self && cmp rail_native /tmp/rail_self  # 2-pass fixed point
./rail_native test 2>&1 > /tmp/t.log &          # run tests in background
tail -f /tmp/t.log                              # watch live (raw, not via grep)
```

Expect ~5-8 minutes for a full self+test+self+cmp cycle. If `test` goes past 12 minutes with no new output, it's the t131 hang — kill and skip.

## Memory + index

- Memory file: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-ledaticempire/memory/rail-https-track-h-active.md` — has the full layer ship table + lessons.
- MEMORY.md has a one-line pointer to the above. Keep them in sync as you ship.

## Stop point

The torch passes to you at `260aebc`. Aim to land 5b.7 first (it's small and flushes FSM bugs before you build on top). Then commit to Layer 6 as a multi-session arc. Layer 7 is a single sitting once Layer 6 lands. Merge to `next-v2.10` only when `https_get api.anthropic.com` returns a real HTTP status.

Good luck.
